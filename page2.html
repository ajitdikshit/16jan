            <li>MWAH YOU'RE MINE</li>
            <li>When I tried to hold ur hand for the first time, I remember we were at the road that turns towards mayuri and I tried to hold ur hand after sooo many efforts. I also asked you that if you are comfortable and you said yes very uncomfortably TWT.</li>
            <li>
                When you were smiling looking at me while I was told I got highest marks in maths class ur face never looked sooooo mwahhhhable. I saw pure love and happiness in those eyes of yours
            </li>
            <li>
                When I started sitting with you in the campus randomly. idk if we should call them dates but definetly that  rose my love for you to the highest. I got to know you much better. we talked laughed and shared our both happy and sad moments.
            </li>
            <li>When I refused to show u my phone you looked really sad. that day I decided im never going to hurt this girl she is already too much for me more than I deserve and I just cant treat her like that so I disposed off all those notes and the belongings too and I committed my notes app to be completely yours from then onwards.</li>
            <li>Countless times when u told me you live being clingy with me mwaaaaaaaah youre mine be clingy with me all day I don't mind.</li>
            <li>Those kisses made my heart melt into yours like its one I cant guess more pure or more affectionate feeling than that.</li>
            <li>The way you ran towards me when you saw ur maths class is just unforgettable hihihii. My baby cant control in public too mwahhhhh!</li>
            <li>The way you brought chocolates for me on my birthday. Ill call it my birthday because it was celebrated that day with you mwahhh.</li>
            <li>And how can i forget today when you held my hand and told me you felt secure. Trust me thats the best feeling than any other in this world for me.</li>
